	abstract = {A majority of cancers are driven by genomic alterations that dysregulate key oncogenic pathways influencing cell growth and survival. However, the ability to harness tumor genetic information for its full clinical potential has only recently become manifest. Over the past several years, the convergence of discovery, technology, and therapeutic development has created an unparalleled opportunity to test the hypothesis that systematic knowledge of genomic information from individual tumors can improve clinical outcomes for many patients with cancer. Rigorous evaluation of this genomics-driven cancer medicine hypothesis will require many logistic innovations that are guided by overarching conceptual advances in tumor genomic profiling, data interpretation, clinical trial design, and the ethical return of genetic results to oncologists and their patients. The results of these efforts and the rigor with which they are implemented will determine whether and how comprehensive tumor genomic information may become incorporated into the routine care of patients with cancer.},
