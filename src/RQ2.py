# Change in commits before and after the transition to conventional commits.

# – How does the average number of files changed per commit change after the adoption
# of conventional commits? Are commits more focused, with fewer files changed per
# commit, or do they become broader in scope?
#
#– Does the number of insertions and deletions per commit increase, decrease, or stay
# the same after the switch? This will help determine whether conventional com-
# mits encourage more granular changes, or simply a change in the way changes
# are grouped within commits.

# – Are there specific types of files (e.g. source code, configuration files, documenta-
# tion) that are more or less likely to be modified after the introduction of conventional
# commits? This might reveal changes in development practices or priorities.

# – Does the adoption of conventional commits lead to more frequent commits, or does
# # it simply change the way changes are structured within existing commit frequencies

#TODO:
# A: Gesamtanzahl der Commits in 2 Gruppen unterteilen: vor und nach Adoption von Conventional Commits
# 2.1 Commit Analyse nach:
# - files changed per commit
# - insertions per commit
# - deletions per commit
# - Zeitraum zu vorherigem Commit

#TODO
# B: Gesamtanzahl der Commits in 3 Gruppen unterteilen: CC-Commits, Custom-Type_Commits und nicht-CC-Commits
# 2.1 Commit Analyse nach:
# - files changed per commit
# - insertions per commit
# - deletions per commit
# - Zeitraum zu vorherigem Commit
# 2.2 Files changed per commit nach Dateityp --> evtl. Exkurs
